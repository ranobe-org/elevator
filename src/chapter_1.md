# Beginnning of the end

She insisted on going on a dinner tonight of all days she decided it was today! I didn't feel right it 
was a long since we last left for a romantic dinner together but she wanted it and I think I liked it too. 
I have been working the day and night shifts it was the only time we could spend together. She was all ready 
and came right to my doorstep. 

We met at college, and we almost shared a bench but she ended up sitting right in front of me. I literally 
stared at her during my freshman year, I was in love, and it turns out she was too. I felt shy talking to her 
at the start but now we are dating, going on dinners, spending evenings reading short stories to each other, 
and laughing at god-awful jokes. I just love her! and apparently, she loves me too. She wouldn't confess it 
right away but I see it!

She was in hurry to go to this new restaurant we just found out about, it was new and not a lot of people started 
going there. She was just like me, hated the crowdy places in the city. She grabbed me by the hand and 
started stretching me downstairs by the elevator. She never stayed nights at my place even though I spent a 
few in her cave-like room.   

We both entered the elevator and she clicked the button to the ground floor even before I can react, she was 
giggling the whole time, shining like a diamond, I have never seen anyone this happy, I felt like I was in heaven, 
and I pull her in my chest. Before she could finish her smile I kissed her and let her know how much I want to 
preserve her and keep her in this time, and never let her go. She knew it all, she smiled at me just like she 
heard me loud and clear and nodding her head, she signed me out of the elevator. 

She looked like an artist on stage thanking the audience to appreciate what she had done. I almost laughed as 
she started to giggle again, she does that a lot. As she smiled back at me still inside the elevator like the 
world has stopped and there is nothing left to do, not even the dinner we were about to go to. I waited and at 
that moment a sudden sound startled me, it was the elevator it shook like an earthquake is about to start, and 
the doors started closing in. I held my breath and was about to get cover when I realized the elevator was now 
sinking into the floor, she was staring into my soul wanting me to hold her. I extended my arms towards her 
shaking body in hopes of picking her up into my arms when the elevator was fast enough that I only could grasp 
her hand. I pull her and with all force and fell to the ground. I pulled and pulled with the full will of my arms. 
I didn't care if the doors would get me and pull my arms apart.  All I wanted was for her to be safe so closed my 
eyes and pulled her out of the trap and the sinking elevator of hell.

I saved her my love was safe and I cried before even seeing her, and she cried loudly as if she were just born. 
I am sorry I said many times my eyes were full of tears and I could only see a small light of her smile and she 
was saying just one thing the whole time. It is ok. I am ok. She said to me and I only could hear her say, "I am 
happy that I loved you and you loved me until the end!". I looked over, towards the elevator and couldn't seek
half of her.
